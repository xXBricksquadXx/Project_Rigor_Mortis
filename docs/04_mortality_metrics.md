# Phase IV: Mortality & Identity Metrics

**Status:** DATA COLLECTION
**Vector:** Psychogenic / Sociogenic
**Primary Datasets:** CDC Mortality (2020-2024), The Trevor Project (2024), Duke Policy Lab

## 1. The Mental Health Baseline (The Trevor Project Data)

**Source:** _The Trevor Project National Survey on LGBTQ+ Youth Mental Health (2024)_
**Metric:** Suicidality and Depression Rates.

- **Key Data Points:**
  - **Suicidality:** 41% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered suicide in the past year.
  - **Attempt Rate:** 14% of transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide.
  - **Comparison:** This rate is significantly higher than the general population baseline (approx. 6% for cisgender youth).
- **Risk Factors Cited:**
  - Lack of access to affirming spaces (Home/School).
  - High exposure to anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric.
  - **Social Media Dependency:** The survey highlights online communities as a primary source of affirmation when physical environments are hostile.

## 2. The "Engagement" Correlation (Hypothesis)

**Variable A:** High Social Media Usage (Time on Device).
**Variable B:** Dissociative Symptoms / Identity Distress.

- **The Mechanism:**
  - **Algorithmic Feedback Loops:** Platforms optimize for retention. If "Identity" content drives engagement, the algorithm prioritizes it.
  - **Echo Chambers:** Users seeking validation may be funneled into hyper-specific communities that reinforce isolation from their physical reality.
- **The "Vulnerability Profile":**
  - Referencing the _Duke University Data Broker Report_: Lists of individuals with "Depression" or "Anxiety" are commercially available.
  - **Theory:** These lists can be used to target vulnerable demographics with content that increases dependency on the platform for emotional regulation.

## 3. Mortality & Morbidity Trends (CDC)

**Source:** _CDC WONDER Database / National Vital Statistics System_

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - **Youth Suicide Rates (10-24):** Generally trending upward over the last decade.
  - **Correlations:** Researchers verify overlapping trends between the introduction of infinite-scroll interfaces (c. 2012) and spikes in youth anxiety/depression.

## 4. Research Objective

To map the overlap between:

1.  **High-Frequency Social Media Users** (Screen Time > 4hrs/day).
2.  **Zip Codes with High "Vulnerability Scores"** (from Phase I).
3.  **Reported Rates of Self-Harm.**

**Goal:** Establish if digital "safe spaces" are functioning as supportive communities or as "retention loops" that monetize vulnerability.
