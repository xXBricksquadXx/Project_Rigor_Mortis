# Project Rigor Mortis: A Symposium of Systemic Toxicity

![Project Banner](./public/banner.png)

**"From the Grain to the Glitch"**

## 1. Abstract

**"Exploration and Illumination"**

This repository serves as a **compendium** of structural parallels between the "Generally Recognized as Safe" (GRAS) loophole in the US food supply and the "Terms of Service" (ToS) consent loopholes in Big Tech. It documents the "Slow Kill" paradigm—where latency is used to obfuscate liability.

> **Status Note:** This project is a living research engine. The current datasets (`.csv`, `.json`) serve as **structural prototypes** to test the logic of the analysis tools (`src/correlation_mapper.py`). As this exploration continues, these placeholders will be replaced with raw, filtered data from federal and NGO sources to rigorously map the correlation between consumption and pathology.

## 2. The Modules (Research Vectors)

### [Phase I: The Biological Backdoor](./docs/01_biological_backdoor.md)

- **Focus:** The "Cereal Killer" Logic (BHT, Chlormequat).
- **The Loophole:** GRAS self-regulation vs. Public Health.

### [Phase II: The Psychological Backdoor](./docs/02_psychological_backdoor.md)

- **Focus:** The API as a Surveillance Tool.
- **The Mechanism:** 3rd Party Data Brokerage & Algorithmic Addiction.

### [Phase III: The Sterility Vector](./docs/03_sterility_vector.md)

- **Focus:** The "Silent Castration" (Porcine/Human Analogs).
- **The Data:** Danish Pig Studies vs. Global Fertility Rates.

### [Phase IV: Mortality & Identity](./docs/04_mortality_metrics.md)

- **Focus:** The Cost of "Programming" & Identity Fracture.
- **The Metric:** Trevor Project 2024 Data vs. High-Engagement Algorithms.

## 3. The Tooling

### [Correlation Mapper](./src/correlation_mapper.py)

- **Objective:** Mapping "Dollar General" density vs. CDC Cancer Rates.
- **Status:** _Prototype Logic Active._
